# classification-of-cardiac_arrhythmia-data

Processed and cleaned data for analysis purpose, and conducted exploratory data analysis to find the relationship between variables.

Multi-Class Classification using an optimized Supervised Machine Learning algorithm

Built classification models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc) to predict if a patient has worse arrhythmia, and using feature reduction techniques like PCA

Evaluate the model fit using confusion matrix and AUC to realize maximum recall rate.
