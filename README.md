# classification-of-cardiac_arrhythmia-data


Multi-Class Classification using an optimized Supervised Machine Learning algorithm

Best Model using Cross Validation (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, PCA)

Built classification models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc) to predict if a patient has worse arrhythmia, and using feature reduction techniques like PCA
